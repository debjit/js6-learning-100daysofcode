## js6- Day 2

Today I learn about
Lessions:
26 : Introducing Functions
A brief description to functions.

27 : Adding A Custom Function
Now I know how to create function, again. Relearning is fun. But you don't need a ; to close a function. My php brain now freaking out telling me syntax error, typo in back of my head.

28 : Code Styles, Conventions & Syntax
Ahh whitespace is a big thing in JS. There is a good and healthy code formatter here.
